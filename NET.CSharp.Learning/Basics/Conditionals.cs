Consider the range of numbers that is required.

Based on the value generated, use the conditional operator to display either heads or tails.

There should be a 50% chance that the result is either heads or tails.

Your code should be easy to read, but with as few lines as possible.

You should be able to accomplish the desired result in three lines of code.
