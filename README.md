### The .NET SDK and .NET Runtime
.NET is a cross-platform, open-source developer platform that's used to develop different types of applications. 

**.NET Runtime**
- The .NET runtime is the code library that's required to run your C# applications.
- .NET runtime referred to as the Common Language Runtime, or CLR.
- The .NET runtime isn't required to write your C# code, but it's required to actually run your C# applications.

**.NET SDK**
- Visual Studio Code uses the .NET SDK and C# extensions to provide a development environment for writing, running, and debugging C# applications.

### Extensions
- Extensions are add-ons that provide additional functionality to Visual Studio Code.
- There are language extensions, theme extensions, and extensions that add new features to Visual Studio Code.
- Visual Studio Code supports the development of C# applications using C# language extensions and the .NET Software Development Kit (SDK).
